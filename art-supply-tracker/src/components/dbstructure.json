//each user has their own tree of categories
//how to ensure names are unique?

//How to sanitize user input? Limit to A-Za-z0-9?
//How to upload/shrink/crop/store images (profile, supply photo, supply swatch)

//Add Art Supply
//Retrieve user categories hierarchy and display in form
//Retrieve properties for category and add input fields for each
//eg Marker -> Color, ....
//Validate properties input (property may/not have pattern)
//Add to user's supplies (insert)
//Upload/save images eg of art supply, demo swatch
//Ensure props are consistent across categories
USER -> CAT -> SUBCATS, PROPS -> TYPE, PATTERN
PROPS -> TYPE, PATTERN
check user props match something in system props
Need: category hierarchy, category props, props type/pattern, user supplies

//Display user's supplies
//Retrieve user's supplies, sorted by category, then name
//Options to filter by properties (how?), sort by properties, values, other fields (?)
USER -> CAT -> SUBCAT -> SUPPLIES, PROPS
PROPS -> TYPE, PATTERN, USERS -> {userId: true, userId: true}
//check user props match something in system props
//should system props list which users use it so only relevant props are option?
Need: category names that contain supplies, user supplies, props

//Edit user's supplies
//Change category (but this would change props - maybe warning saying which props would be removed from the supply?)
//Change name
//Change quantity
//Change brand
//Change props
Need: category props type/pattern, supplies

//Wishlist
//Add existing supply to wishlist
//Remove from wishlist
//Add new supply to wishlist
USER - Categories - Props, Supplies, Wishlist
Need: categories -> wishlist

//Account
//Add user image (how to store?)
//Update email
//Verify email
//Update display name
//Reset password
//Built into Firebase Auth

//System Settings
//Create a new category (how to ensure name is not being used already?)
//Delete a category (prevented if supplies exist under it)
//Change category name, props (force update of supplies), parent category

//Create a new property
//Rename
//Change type, pattern (force update of supplies)
//Delete a property (warn this deletes from all supplies)

--------------------------------------------------
That was too complicated and I got confused. Starting over just with core features.

//ADD ART SUPPLY
//Display Category Hierarchy
//Select one
//Add Cat props to form
//Select another
//Remove/add Cat props to form
//Enter data
//Save -> Validate using type/pattern of props of category
//Check that name is unique for that category
//Insert into database
//SET user/supplies/category/supplyName: {propValues}
//You will need: user (from Auth), category hierarchy, category props, props validation, check that name does not exist in that category

//DISPLAY ART SUPPLIES
//GET userId/supplies
//for each supply, add row: name, brand, qty ... prop1, prop2, prop3
//To filter: MUST INCLUDE prop x, prop/field x must have value y, ...
//To sort: initially by category, then name, option to sort by props (if no value for that prop, at bottom)
//You will need: supplies: category -> supply1, supply2 -> qty, location, brand, prop1 -> "value"

//PROFILE SETTINGS

//CREATE CATEGORY
//Display hierarchy
//Get name and desired parent
//Get desired properties
//Check that name not already in parent
//Insert into parent
//You will need: available properties, category hierarchy
